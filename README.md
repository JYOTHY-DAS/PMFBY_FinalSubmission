# PMFBY Farmers' Contribution Forecasting

## Overview
This project aims to forecast farmers' contributions to the **Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)** using historical crop insurance data. By analyzing past patterns, the model provides insights into contribution trends, optimizing subsidy allocation and enhancing transparency in policy-making.

## Objective
- Forecast farmers' contributions to PMFBY using historical data on crop insurance coverage.

## Use Cases
- Identify patterns and trends in farmers' contributions.
- Optimize subsidy allocation for maximum coverage and equity.
- Enhance transparency and decision-making in policy design.

## Dataset
The dataset contains historical records related to PMFBY, including information on insured crops, subsidy status, sum insured, and farmers' contributions.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing trends and patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Selecting and creating relevant features.
4. **Model Selection:** Training and evaluating predictive models.
5. **Deployment:** Deploying the final model as an interactive web application using Flask.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (`pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
- **Flask** (For web application deployment)
- **Machine Learning Models** (Regression-based models for forecasting)
- **GitHub Pages / Heroku / Render** (For hosting the web app, if applicable)

## Model Deployment
The final model is deployed using **Flask** and **Streamlit** allowing stakeholders to interactively explore predictions. The web application takes user inputs, processes them, and returns forecasted farmers' contributions.
